# Payment Dummy App Backend

This repository contains the backend implementation for a mockup payment application designed to simulate user signups, authentication, and transaction processes. It's built using Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB with Mongoose for database interactions. The backend supports secure user authentication, account management, and fund transfer functionalities.

## Technologies Used

- **Node.js & Express.js**: For creating the server and RESTful API.
- **MongoDB & Mongoose**: For database management and schema definitions.
- **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)**: For securing routes and user authentication.
- **Postman**: Used for testing API endpoints.
- **Middleware**: To reduce code repetition and improve security.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js installed on your system.
- MongoDB database setup (locally or cloud-based with MongoDB Atlas).
- Postman for testing API requests.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/sanchit-560/payment-dummy-app-backend.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```
   cd payment-dummy-app-backend
   ```
3. Install the necessary packages:
   ```
   npm install
   ```

### Running the Application

1. Start the server:
   ```
   npm start
   ```
2. The server will be running on `http://localhost:3000`.

## Features

### User Authentication

- **Sign Up**: Users can create a new account.
- **Sign In**: Users can log in to their account.
- **Update Information**: Authenticated users can update their personal information.

### Account Management

- **View Balance**: Users can retrieve their current account balance.
- **Transfer Funds**: Users can transfer funds to another account, with validations for sufficient balance and recipient account existence.

### Security

- **JWT Authentication**: Secures routes to ensure that only authenticated users can access sensitive endpoints.
- **Middleware**: Custom middleware for checking authentication tokens and handling repeated tasks.

### Testing with Postman


## User

### Endpoints:

- **Sign In**: 
  - Endpoint: `http://localhost:3000/api/v1/user/signin`
  - Method: POST
  - Description: Used for user authentication and login.
  
- **Sign Up**:
  - Endpoint: `http://localhost:3000/api/v1/user/signup`
  - Method: POST
  - Description: Used for creating a new user account.

- **Bulk User Search**:
  - Endpoint: `http://localhost:3000/api/v1/user/bulk?filter=Khosla`
  - Method: PUT
  - Description: Used for filtering users by firstName/lastName or any characters.
 
  Certainly, here's the updated section for the "User" heading in your README file:

### Account

### Endpoints:

- **Balance**:
  - Endpoint: `http://localhost:3000/api/v1/account/balance`
  - Method: GET
  - Description: Used for retrieving the balance of the user's account.

- **Transfer**:
  - Endpoint: `http://localhost:3000/api/v1/account/transfer`
  - Method: POST
  - Description: Used for transferring funds from the user's account to another account.

### Testing:
To test these endpoints, you can use tools like Postman or make requests directly from your frontend application. Ensure that the server is running on `http://localhost:3001` before making any requests. ---

This project allows for a comprehensive demonstration of backend development skills, including API development, database management, authentication, and handling of financial transactions, providing a strong foundation for further development and learning in the field of web development.
